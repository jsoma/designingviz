# Rounding off numbers

Instead of picking numbers that exactly fit the upper and lower bounds of your data, **round to clean-looking numbers**.

This applies to ranges and boundaries, too.

## Example

Your smallest number is 8.4, and your largest number is 23,948. Because you value being specific, you put those numbers on your scale.

Unfortunately, **it's kind of tough to read at a glance**. People like round numbers. Adjust your scale to 0 to 24,000, not because of Science but because of Human Beings.

## Example

You've used some sort of magic algorithm to put your content into buckets.

**You need a lot of brainpower to parse those hyper-specific numbers!** Unless it really, really ruins your display or conveys inaccurate information, change your scale to reflect something a little more human.
