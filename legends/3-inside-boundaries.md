# Removing inside boundaries

Maybe **the actual numbers on your scale don't really matter**, and you're just trying to say "A is more than B is more than C". In this cases like that, where you're interested in a **general upward or downward trend**, you might experiment with only displaying the maximum and minimum of your scale instead of outlining each boundary or color.

## Example

Maybe we start with a scale showing you every single break from 0 to 100.

But maybe the difference between 24 and 55 don't really matter - we're just trying to show a **general upward or downward trend**. In that case we can simplify the scale to only show the maximum and minimum numbers.

It certainly doesn't give the user as much information, but sometimes that information just isn't necessary.
