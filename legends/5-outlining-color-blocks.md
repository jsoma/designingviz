# Outlining color blocks

If you're pushed your color blocks up against each other, you should **remove the outlines around individual color segments**. By default your legend might look like this:

Removing the outlines around each color makes your graphic a lot cleaner. You can also use an **outer border** to separate the legend colors from the graph background.

A lot nicer, right?
