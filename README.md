# [A Step-by-Step Design Guide for Data Visualizations](http://designingviz.com/)

A simple guide to how to make your visualizations look a little more pleasant, since we don't all have mentors or bosses or kind-hearted friends with a sense of directness.

Every time you build a viz and aren't quite satisfied with it, just step through these questions and you'll get some ideas on how to spruce things up.

## Using this guide

You can browse and edit in this repo, but you should really visit the site at [http://designingviz.com](http://designingviz.com).

In case you haven't noticed, it's a work in progress.

## Focus

The focus for the time being is **practical applied design**, not so much how to pick the right chart or theory etc etc etc. [The Wall Street Journal Guide to Information Graphics](http://amzn.to/2ihAyF5) is immeasurably perfect for the data-y parts of things. [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](http://amzn.to/2hS0zOj) is stellar if you'd like something a little more in the theoretical realm.

I'd love contributions! You should definitely read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you're interested.
