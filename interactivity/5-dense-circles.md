# Dense circles

If your visualization has a dense area of **overlapping circles** you'd like to hover over, it can sometimes make for a difficult user experience. 

To make things easier for your reader, don't wait for the hover event - just find the circle that has a center closest to the mouse coordinates and pretend you're hovering over it.
