# Close enough should be good enough

No matter what your elements are, **they shouldn't be difficult to click on or hover over**. If you have to fight your mouse to line things up juuuuuust right, make some changes in how elements are selected. Some options might be:

* Picking the closest point instead of requiring a direct hover/click
* Adding a buffer zone to make your elements' hoverable/clickable area larger (e.g. transparent overlay)
* Adding separate tools for selecting data points (dropdowns, filter menus, etc)
