# Citing sources

Since your graphic might be separated from your written piece, it's a good idea to **cite your data source(s) on the graphic itself**. The **bottom left-hand corner** is the traditional place for this, in a nice small font.

You can either just name the source or get a little more formal with **Data: Wherever** or **Source: Wherever**.

## Example

Let's say you're using [Sex by Marital Status By Age For the Population 15 Year and Over](http://old.socialexplorer.com/pub/reportdata/metabrowser.aspx?survey=ACS2012&ds=American+Community+Survey+2012&table=B12002&header=True) from the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey. You could cite your data source as...

* US Census Burea
* American Community Survey
* US Census Bureau, American Community Survey
* ACS 2016, Table B12002

It really depends on what looks the best and who your audience is. It's fine if you're vague in your graphic if you're more specific in the written piece.
