# Directly labeling your data points

Instead of having a key to understand a color or making your user rely on an axis to understand a value, sometimes you can just **write the value next to the circle/bar/whatever**.

For example, you have a bar representing Peru's GDP in 2013. You could have your reader slowly trace a line from the end of the bar down to the axis and estimate that it's *kind of a little above 200 billion*, or you could just **write 202.3 billion at the end of the bar**.

You usually only use this with smaller data sets and/or with smaller numbers. Having to write out numbers like "34,520" clutters your graph up quickly.
