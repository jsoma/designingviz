# Make unimportant things grey

Grey is a very useful color for things that aren't very important. Use grey to color elements that...

* are unselected or backgrounded
* provide context to an important data point
* are not the currently selected element

In fact, let's just make **grey the default color**. Everything should be grey! Unless of course you'd feel comfortable shouting that data point out at a stranger.

I say err on the side of making your greys lighter rather than darker.

## Example

You have a line graph of life expectancy over time for 20 different countries. You're currently interested in India.

Make the 19 countries that *aren't* India grey, and then India gets to be red or green or whatever your favorite highlight color is.
