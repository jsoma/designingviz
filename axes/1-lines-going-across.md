# Using full-width grid or tick lines

Use full-width lines with your tick marks when **specific numbers are really important.**

If your reader only needs to know that **A** is bigger than **B**, don't use full-width lines, just use small ticks on the axis. If your reader is going to spend some time with the graphic and be interested that A is **45.65** and B is **37.66**, that's when you use full-width lines.
