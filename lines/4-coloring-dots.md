# Backgrounding data dots on lines

If you're plotting dots on your lines, you have two options for coloring your dots:

* If the line is more important than the data point or you're trying to background the dots, **color each dot the same color as the line it is on**. This is cleaner-looking.
* If the data point is more important than the data point, **color each dot black or dark grey**. This is more data dense.

This is unusual in that grey usually backgrounds data - on a line graph with colored lines, though, it makes them stand out. To background you really need to match colors with the lines themselves.
