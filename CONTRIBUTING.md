# How to contribute

I sure don't know everything. You might, though, so let's do this!

## Providing ideas

Click 'Issues' up at the top of the page and add a new issue describing what you'd like added. Someone will hopefully hop onto it!

## Providing content

If you'd like a technical overview of how to contribute to a project on GitHub, [this guide](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/) should cover that part. I'll make a video for non-technical contributions at some point.

### Writing your content

Pages are written as [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) files, which is just annotated text. A good editor for OS X is [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/).

A file will look something like this:

    # This is the page title

    Here you're providing a 50-75 word summary and now here's an image:

    ![](assets/your-image.png)

    ## Example

    Under this subheading you can provide more words, walking the reader through an example with a few more images.

Other tips:

* The title of the page gets a `#` at the beginning of a line.
* Any page section title (Example, style tips, etc) gets a `##` at the beginning of a line.
* You should try to not write more than 100 words in the first section (50-75 is preferred). If you have more than 100 words, move some of it into a new section. Any other section can have billions of words, I don't mind.

### Saving your file(s)

Save your page in a folder named after the topic. For example, is it about legends? Saving in `legends/` would seem like a good idea.

* Since we're writing in Markdown, the filename should end in `.md`
* **Don't put spaces in the filename, use dashes instead**
* Any additional images/etc should go into the `assets/` folder

**Note:** All of the files in `legends/` will be compacted together and turned into a single file about legends.

### Creating images

You can use the Adobe Illustrator files inside of the `_scratch` folder if you'd like. There's a `README` with more details [right in there](_scratch).

Some images are created automatically from the Illustrator files; they all have `ai-` in the beginning of their filename. If you add a file manually, **don't prefix it with `ai-`**.

## Being totally angry at my design proposals, because they are the dumbest thing you've ever seen in your entire life and you've been around for a LONG time
